<!--
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The semantic tags describe and imply meaning to the browser. The tags I see as most useful are the tags that are the most commonplace and also help to communicate meaning to developers reading the HTML.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser will read the elements from top to bottom in order of how they are written in the HTML doc. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned that Sublime text offers cool tools like creating snippets that will help to make coding easier. I definitely will utilize the snippets tool at a later date and can imagine it coming in handy when creating templatized sites.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
The most difficult part of the challenge was recreating a table in HTML from memory! I feel comfortable with this element but think I need more time coding to be able to quickly recall these things!

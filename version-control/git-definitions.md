# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 
Version control is a system that organizes and tracks changes in files. Version control is useful because it keeps track of the history of the revisions made to the code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the master file of the project. This is used to make updates and add features to software while keeping the master clean and bug free.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit records and saves changes to a repository. A good commit message will provide a straightforward snapshot of changes made in a line or two.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict usually occurs when your current branch and the branch you want to merge into the current branch have diverged.

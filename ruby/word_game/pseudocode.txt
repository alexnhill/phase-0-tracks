Release 1: Design a Game

#Define a class with following attributes:
	#secret_word (editable)- this is the initalize argument
	#guess_counter = 0
	#game_over = false
	#placeholder_word

#count guesses method
	#count guess each time it is run
		#puts you have _ guesses- determine number of guesses based on word length (2x guesses?)
		#input.length * 2
		#doesnt count if its a repeated guess

#guess method to check letters in the word
	#stores guesses in array
	#guess the word into an array- check by doing array.index("x")=>returns the index
	#.gsub

#guess feedback method (if/else)
	#generate a placeholder based on .length of input and replace each letter when char at index of other matches
	#if, correct- swap the char and say how many guesses are left
	#else, spit out array of blanks and say how many guesses are left
	#if there are no - in array, congratulate
	#else, game over and taunt

#Predicate method in place of UI- to ask the game, are you done?
	-if game_over = false
	-method within class
	-check conditions including:
		-guesses are less than num_guesses
		-if placeholder word != secret_word

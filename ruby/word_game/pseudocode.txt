Release 1: Design a Game

#Define a class with following attributes:
	#secret_word (editable)- this is the initalize argument
	#guess_counter = 0
	#game_over = false

#guess method to check letters in the word
	#puts you have _ guesses- determine number of guesses based on word length (2x guesses?)
	#input.length * 2
	#guess the word into an array- check by doing array.index("x")=>returns the index
	#splits into an array- split(' ')
	#count guesses
		#repeated guesses dont count againt user

#guess feedback method (if/else)
	#stores guesses in array
	#generate a placeholder based on .length of input and replace each letter when char at index of other matches
	#if, correct- swap the char and say how many guesses are left
	#else, spit out array of blanks and say how many guesses are left
	#if there are no - in array, congratulate
	#else, game over and taunt
